# Live Demo
The templates that are published here form the core of the [*Nobel Prize app*](https://github.com/metaphacts/nobel-prize/). 

The *Nobel Prize app* enables search, exploration and discoverability of awarded Nobel Prizes and Laureates. 

To showcase how [metaphactory](https://metaphacts.com/product) can deliver a smooth and intuitive end-user interaction on top of knowledge graphs, the *Nobel Prize app* together with the *Nobel Prize branding app* have been published as a live demo: https://nobelprize.metaphacts.cloud.
