This repository hosts the template snippets that are referenced in two of the Amazon Partner Network blog posts discussing the benefits of connecting the Amazon Neptune to [metaphactory platform](https://metaphacts.com/product).

[The first blog post](some%20URL) describes how metaphactory can be connected to [Amazon Nepture](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) tripple store to enable data visualization and exploration. [The second blog post](One-more-URL) talks about building the end user application for searching and navigation tailored to the Nobel Prize dataset (Nobel Prize dataset is hosted by metaphacts on [S3 bucket here](https://metaphacts-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/nobel-prize-bundle.trig.gz)). 

Following two blog posts and copying the templates to own instance of metaphactory the reader will be able to reproduce the application that drives the publically accessible [Nobel prize live demo](https://nobelprize.metaphacts.cloud/) . 

If you have any feedback about the live demo or the templates published in this repository, please reach out to dp@metaphacts.com.
